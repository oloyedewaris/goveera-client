# Goveera front-end

A front-end web application developed with react.js

### [Live Demo](https://goveera-client.pages.dev "Goveera")

### How to run this app locally

- Ensure to have node.js installed on your computer
- Clone or download this repository
- Run npm install or yarn add in command prompt or terminal to install dependencies 
- Run npm start to start the project
- Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app

#### This front-end project works together with the [Back end](https://github.com/oloyedewaris/goveera-server "Back-end"), if you wish to change this and work with the live-server, change the BASE_URL in src/util/constants file

#### I intentionally reveal and use the same firebase keys as that of the project so as to synchronize existing data, i will remove and change it when about to release the app

## Future integration to this app


Enjoy...
